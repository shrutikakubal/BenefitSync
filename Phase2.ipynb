       "'In addition to traditional gym memberships, all TechLance employees and their families have\\ncomplimentary access to our curated online ﬁtness platform, which includes workout videos,\\nwellness content, and live virtual classes. We also provide premium subscriptions to popular\\nﬁtness apps such as Peloton Digital, Nike Training Club, and Headspace for meditation and\\nmindfulness training.\\nEnrollment Process and Payment Options\\nGetting started with our ﬁtness beneﬁts is straightforward, though it requires some planning and\\ndocumentation. All active full-time and part-time employees working at least 20 hours per week\\nare eligible for ﬁtness beneﬁts immediately upon hire, with no waiting period or probationary\\nrequirements.\\nTo enroll, employees ﬁrst browse available ﬁtness partners through our beneﬁts portal,\\ncomparing locations, amenities, class schedules, and member ratings. Once you’ve selected a\\npreferred facility, you’ll need to complete the enrollment process through our portal, uploading\\nemployment veriﬁcation documents such as a recent pay stub or HR veriﬁcation letter, along with\\nphoto identiﬁcation and emergency contact information.\\nMost ﬁtness centers also require completion of a basic health questionnaire and liability waiver\\nbefore beginning membership. Some facilities may have additional requirements or capacity\\nlimitations that could aﬀect immediate availability.\\nTechLance oﬀers two payment options for ﬁtness memberships. Payroll deduction is the most\\npopular choice, allowing automatic monthly deduction from your paycheck using pre-tax dollars\\nthrough our Flexible Spending Account program. This option provides immediate tax savings and\\nensures that your membership payments are consistent even if membership fees increase.\\nAlternatively, you can choose to pay the ﬁtness center directly, which oﬀers more ﬂexibility for\\npausing or modifying memberships but doesn’t provide the same tax advantages.\\nUsage Guidelines and Facility Policies'"
