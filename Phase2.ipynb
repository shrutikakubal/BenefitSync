      "from life insurance are generally not subject to income tax for beneﬁciaries, making it an eﬃcient\n",

      "Frequently Asked Questions\n",
      "The prescription drug coverage varies by plan but generally includes four tiers of medications\n",
      "with diﬀerent cost-sharing levels. Generic medications (Tier 1) have the lowest copays, typically\n",
      "around $10 for a 30-day supply, while brand-name and specialty medications have higher copays\n",
      "or coinsurance requirements. You can save money by using mail-order pharmacy services for 90-\n",
      "day supplies of maintenance medications.\n",
      "Understanding Your Beneﬁts\n",
      "Each plan has diﬀerent cost-sharing structures that determine how much you’ll pay for various\n",
      "services. Copays are ﬁxed amounts you pay for speciﬁc services, like $25 for a primary care visit,\n",
      "while coinsurance means you pay a percentage of the total cost after meeting your deductible.\n",
      "For example, if your plan has 20% coinsurance for hospital stays, you would pay 20% of the\n",
      "hospital bill after your deductible is met, up to your annual out-of-pocket maximum.\n",
      "The annual deductible is the amount you must pay out-of-pocket before your insurance begins\n",
      "paying for most services. However, preventive care and some other services are covered even\n",
      "before you meet your deductible. Once you reach your annual out-of-pocket maximum, your\n",
      "insurance covers 100% of covered services for the rest of the year.\n",
      "In-network providers have contracts with our insurance company that result in lower costs for\n",
      "both you and the insurance plan. Out-of-network providers don’t have these contracts, which\n",
      "typically means higher costs and more paperwork for you. While our PPO and HDHP plans\n",
      "provide some coverage for out-of-network care, the HMO plan only covers out-of-network care\n",
      "in emergency situations.\n",
      "Finding Providers and Managing Care\n",
      "To ﬁnd in-network providers, you can use the insurance company’s online directory, download\n",

We also provide premium subscriptions to popular\\nﬁtness apps such as Peloton Digital, Nike Training Club, and Headspace for meditation and\\nmindfulness training.\\nEnrollment Process and Payment Options\\nGetting started with our ﬁtness beneﬁts is straightforward, though it requires some planning and\\ndocumentation. All active full-time and part-time employees working at least 20 hours per week\\nare eligible for ﬁtness beneﬁts immediately upon hire, with no waiting period or probationary\\nrequirements.\\nTo enroll, employees ﬁrst browse available ﬁtness partners through our beneﬁts portal,\\ncomparing locations, amenities, class schedules, and member ratings. Once you’ve selected a\\npreferred facility, you’ll need to complete the enrollment process through our portal, uploading\\nemployment veriﬁcation documents such as a recent pay stub or HR veriﬁcation letter, along with\\nphoto identiﬁcation and emergency contact information.\\nMost ﬁtness centers also require completion of a basic health questionnaire and liability waiver\\nbefore beginning membership. Some facilities may have additional requirements or capacity\\nlimitations that could aﬀect immediate availability.\\nTechLance oﬀers two payment options for ﬁtness memberships. Payroll deduction is the most\\npopular choice, allowing automatic monthly deduction from your paycheck using pre-tax dollars\\nthrough our Flexible Spending Account program. This option provides immediate tax savings and\\nensures that your membership payments are consistent even if membership fees increase.\\nAlternatively, you can choose to pay the ﬁtness center directly, which oﬀers more ﬂexibility for\\npausing or modifying memberships but doesn’t provide the same tax advantages.\\nUsage Guidelines and Facility Policies'), Document(id='1d487c85-2cb0-4261-96a3-aa64102a4384', metadata={'policy': 'gym-policy.pdf', 'page': 0}, page_content='TechLance Gym Membership Policy'), Document(id='bd11d47d-dff7-4d29-8769-536de31ca1df', metadata={'page': 6, 'policy': 'gym-policy.pdf'}, page_content='How much money can I save with corporate gym memberships? Savings range from 25% to\\n50% depending on the facility tier. For example, a typical $50 monthly gym membership might\\ncost you only $25-37.50 with our corporate discounts.\\nCan I use multiple gym memberships simultaneously? Generally, you can only have one active\\ncorporate membership at a time, though you may be able to access diﬀerent locations within the\\nsame network or chain.\\nWhat happens to my membership if I leave TechLance? Corporate discount rates end on your\\nlast day of employment, but you can typically continue membership at regular rates or cancel\\naccording to the facility’s standard terms.\\nAre personal training sessions included in my membership? Basic corporate memberships\\ntypically include access to equipment and group classes. Personal training is usually available at\\nadditional cost, though many facilities oﬀer member discounts.\\nCan I freeze my membership for medical reasons or extended travel? Most partner facilities\\nallow membership freezes for medical reasons or extended travel. Contact the facility directly to\\nunderstand their speciﬁc freeze policies and any associated fees.\\nHow do I switch from one gym to another partner facility? You can change partners during open\\nenrollment periods or for qualifying life events. Some changes may require a brief waiting period\\nbetween memberships depending on the facilities involved.\\nCan I get reimbursed for ﬁtness classes outside of partner gyms? Limited reimbursement may be\\navailable through your wellness allowance for specialized classes not available at partner\\nlocations, such as martial arts or specialized training programs.\\nWhat if there are no partner gyms convenient to my home or work location? We regularly\\nevaluate and add new partners based on employee requests. You can submit requests for speciﬁc\\nfacilities through the beneﬁts portal, and we’ll investigate partnership opportunities in your area.\\nThis policy is eﬀective immediately and may be updated to reﬂect changes in partnerships, beneﬁt\\nlevels, or program oﬀerings. TechLance reserves the right to modify ﬁtness beneﬁts with appropriate\\nnotice to employees. Individual facility terms and conditions apply to all memberships.'), Document(id='f62209a3-eaab-40e8-899e-8f341a5776d4', metadata={'policy': 'gym-policy.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Once enrolled, you’ll receive a TechLance corporate membership card that identiﬁes you as a\\ncorporate member and ensures you receive the negotiated discount rates. You’ll also need to\\npresent photo identiﬁcation during initial setup and periodic veriﬁcation visits. Some locations\\nmay also require your TechLance employee badge for veriﬁcation.\\nMost partner locations provide guest privileges as part of corporate memberships, typically\\nallowing two guest passes per month at standard partner facilities. Additional guest visits are\\navailable at reduced day rates, and all guests must be at least 18 years old and sign liability\\nwaivers. Premium locations such as Equinox may limit guest privileges to one pass per month,\\nand some boutique studios may not oﬀer guest access at all.\\nClass booking and cancellation policies vary by facility, but most allow you to reserve popular\\nclasses up to seven days in advance through their mobile apps or websites. To avoid fees, you\\nshould cancel class reservations at least two hours before the scheduled start time. Excessive no-\\nshows may result in booking restrictions, so it’s important to be realistic about your schedule\\nwhen making reservations.\\nGeneral ﬁtness center etiquette applies to all TechLance members, including time limits on cardio\\nequipment during peak hours, wiping down equipment after use, allowing others to work in\\nduring rest periods, and following all posted safety guidelines. Appropriate athletic attire and\\nclosed-toe shoes are required at all facilities, and members should respect locker room privacy\\nand cleanliness standards.\\nWellness Integration and Incentive Programs\\nOur ﬁtness beneﬁts are closely integrated with TechLance’s broader wellness program through\\nour points-based incentive system. Employees earn wellness points for various ﬁtness activities,\\nincluding 10 points per gym check-in (maximum 50 points per week), 15 points for attending\\ngroup ﬁtness classes, and 25 points for personal training sessions. Participation in company-\\nsponsored wellness events can earn up to 50 points per activity.\\nThese wellness points can be redeemed for various rewards and contribute to health insurance\\npremium discounts. Basic participation in ﬁtness activities can reduce your monthly health')]\n",
