      "The prescription drug coverage varies by plan but generally includes four tiers of medications\n",
      "with diﬀerent cost-sharing levels. Generic medications (Tier 1) have the lowest copays, typically\n",
      "around $10 for a 30-day supply, while brand-name and specialty medications have higher copays\n",
      "or coinsurance requirements. You can save money by using mail-order pharmacy services for 90-\n",
      "day supplies of maintenance medications.\n",
      "Understanding Your Beneﬁts\n",
      "Each plan has diﬀerent cost-sharing structures that determine how much you’ll pay for various\n",
      "services. Copays are ﬁxed amounts you pay for speciﬁc services, like $25 for a primary care visit,\n",
      "while coinsurance means you pay a percentage of the total cost after meeting your deductible.\n",
      "For example, if your plan has 20% coinsurance for hospital stays, you would pay 20% of the\n",
      "hospital bill after your deductible is met, up to your annual out-of-pocket maximum.\n",
      "The annual deductible is the amount you must pay out-of-pocket before your insurance begins\n",
      "paying for most services. However, preventive care and some other services are covered even\n",

      "In-network providers have contracts with our insurance company that result in lower costs for\n",
      "both you and the insurance plan. Out-of-network providers don’t have these contracts, which\n",
