      "\n",
      "- **Eligibility to Use Vacation Time**: \n",
      "  - Newly hired employees must complete 90 days of employment before they can use any vacation time, unless it was pre-planned and approved during the hiring process or in cases of genuine emergencies that require manager approval. (According to the vacation-policy.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Vacation Accrual**: \n",
      "  - Vacation time accrues monthly at a rate of one-twelfth of your annual allocation. If you start on July 1st, for example, you would receive half of your annual vacation allocation for that first year, with the remainder available on your first anniversary. (According to the vacation-policy.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Scheduling and Approval Process**: \n",
      "  - You must provide advance notice for your vacation request:\n",
      "    - **1-2 days**: At least **one week** notice\n",
      "    - **3-4 days**: At least **two weeks** notice\n",
      "    - **5 or more consecutive days**: At least **three weeks** notice\n",
      "    - During peak business periods, **four weeks** notice is required. (According to the vacation-policy.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Request Submission**: \n",
      "  - All vacation requests must be submitted through the HR portal or directly to your manager for approval. Your manager will consider team coverage needs and project deadlines before approving. Once approved, HR will confirm your vacation balance and send you an email confirmation. (According to the vacation-policy.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Vacation Duration**: \n",
      "  - Vacation can be taken in increments as small as four hours (half day), with a maximum limit of **10 consecutive business days** for vacation requests without special approval. Longer vacations require director-level approval. (According to the vacation-policy.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Additional Considerations**: \n",
      "  - You may use vacation time for mental health days or personal wellness. If you exhaust your vacation time, you may request unpaid personal leave for up to **30 days** with manager approval. (According to the vacation-policy.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure to plan your holiday considering these guidelines to ensure a smooth approval process. If you have any specific dates in mind, it’s best to submit your request as soon as possible.\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Corporate Discounts**: You can save between 25% to 50% on gym memberships depending on the facility tier. For example, a typical $50 monthly gym membership might cost you only $25 to $37.50 with the corporate discounts (as stated in the gym-policy.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Active Membership**: Generally, you can only have one active corporate membership at a time. However, you may access different locations within the same network or chain (according to the gym-policy.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Membership Continuation**: If you leave TechLance, the corporate discount rates will end on your last day of employment. You can typically continue your membership at regular rates or cancel according to the facility’s standard terms (as mentioned in the gym-policy.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Membership Freezes**: Most partner facilities allow you to freeze your membership for medical reasons or extended travel. You should contact the facility directly to understand their specific freeze policies and any associated fees (as stated in the gym-policy.pdf).\n",
